# WWDC19-Submission
This is my submission for the 2019 WWDC Scholarship, which I was fortunate enough to be awarded. The Playground appears to emulate an iPhoneX, until the tab bar is swiped up and the apps become subject to gravity. The goal is to correctly memorize their order and replace them where they began.
